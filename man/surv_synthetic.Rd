\arguments{
\item{df}{a dataframe containing the output from \code{format_dhs}, or optionally, dataframe
containing the following columns}

\item{individual}{column corresponding to individual ID in \code{df}}

\item{survey}{boolean for whether or not your data comes from a survey with a specified probability design.
If true, must specify household, cluster, strata, and weights parameters in the function, and a finite
population variance based on a pseudo-likelihood will be returned for your survey-weighted estimates.
If false, superpopulation estimates will be returned with the usual asymptotic variance estimator.
Defaults to \code{TRUE}.}

\item{household}{column corresponding to household ID in \code{df}}

\item{cluster}{column corresponding to cluster ID in \code{df}}

\item{strata}{column corresponding to strata ID in \code{df}}

\item{weights}{column corresponding to weights in \code{df}. If survey = FALSE, you may
still specify a weights column, but note that the superpopulation variance will be returned
as opposed to the finite population variance.}

\item{p}{column corresponding to period ID (must be integer-valued, numeric) in \code{df}}

\item{a_pi}{column corresponding to child's age at beginning of time period in \code{df}}

\item{l_p}{column corresponding to length of time period in \code{df}}

\item{I_i}{column corresponding to indicator for interval censoring in \code{df}. Should be 1 if
child is interval-censored, 0 if right-censored.}

\item{A_i}{column corresponding to indicator for if a child is interval-censored across the
boundary of a time period in \code{df}}

\item{t_i}{column corresponding to age at right-censoring, if right-censored, in \code{df}}

\item{t_0i}{column corresponding to lower bound of interval, if interval-censored, in \code{df}}

\item{t_1i}{column corresponding to upper bound of interval, if interval-censored, in \code{df}}

\item{only_scale}{boolean for varying only the scale parameter across time period. Defaults to
\code{FALSE}. This option is only available for dist = "weibull"}

\item{numerical_grad}{boolean for whether gradient should be calculated numerically or
analytically. Analytical gradient is faster, but only available for Weibull and Exponential distributions
at the moment.}

\item{dist}{distribution. Currently supports "weibull", "exponential",
"piecewise_exponential", "gengamma", "lognormal", "gompertz", "etsp" (exponentially-truncated shifted power family),
"loglogistic", "dagum". The loglogistic and piecewise exponential distributions are constrained
to have a monotonically non-increasing hazard. See Details for more.}

\item{breakpoints}{if distribution is "piecewise_exponential", the breakpoints (in months) where
the distribution should be divided}

\item{init_vals}{an optional vector of initial values at which to start the optimizer for the
parameters. Must specify the appropriate number of parameters for the given distribution /
number of periods.}
}
\value{
A list containing:
\itemize{
\item result: a dataframe of summarized results
order arrange(time). Each matrix will have rows arranged in order arrange(region).
\item optim: the output from \code{optim}
\item grad: the gradient evaluated at the MLE
\item variance: the finite population variance-covariance matrix
\item design: the survey design object
\item runtime: runtime for likelihood optimization
\item initial_values: initial values for parameters used in likelihood maximization
